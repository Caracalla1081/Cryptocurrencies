# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose
Having done research on unsupervised machine learning and proven my skill, and the benefits of unsupervised learning in our previous project, I have now been tasked with assisting one of our investment bank clients in  analyzing best options for offering a cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients. 

This is to be accomplished by using unsupervised learning, specifically a clustering algorithim, to create a report for our client that could assist them in grouping various cyrptocurrencies on the trading market and create a classification system for these new investments.

## Objectives Completed
- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
